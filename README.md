## Files manager
- Wrap-up of the backend trimester:
    - Authentication
    - NodeJS
    - MongoDB
    - Redis
    - Pagination
    - Background processing
- The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:
    - User authentication via a token
    - List all files
    - Upload a new file
    - Change permission of a file
    - View a file
    - Generate thumbnails for images
- *Note*: There is already such a system in real life, this is just for learning, experience how different parts of such a project are assembled.

The learning objectives of this project are:
- how to create an API with Express
- how to authenticate a user
- how to store data in MongoDB
- how to store temporary data in Redis
- how to setup and use a background worker
